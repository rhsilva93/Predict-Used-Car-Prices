# Predict-Used-Car-Prices
Second attempt at predicting the price of a used car depending on its specifications like mileage, engine size, year, model, and brand. The first attempt had the model explaining roughly 75% of the variability of the data. This second attempt explains roughly 93% of the variability of the data. The predictive power of this new model is much better however weights are misleading sadly. This second attempt was improved by adding the variable 'model' into the regression. However, doing this made some issues come up in our model. There is now multicollinearity which is why some weights are inflated. There are also outliers that we did not deal with because we did not expect to use the 'Model' variable. We fixed this issue in an easy but naive way, by binding any value of the car that is greater than the maximum of $150,000. That way a car cannot cost more than $150,000.
